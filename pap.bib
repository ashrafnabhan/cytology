  abstract      = {OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in the use of cervical cancer screening tests      during 2013-2019 among commercially insured women. METHODS: The study      population included women of all ages with continuous enrollment each year      in the IBM MarketScan commercial or Medicare supplemental databases and      without known history of cervical cancer or precancer (range = 6.9-9.8      million women per year). Annual cervical cancer screening test use was      examined by three modalities: cytology alone, cytology plus HPV testing      (cotesting), and HPV testing alone. Trends were assessed using 2-sided      Poisson regression. RESULTS: Use of cytology alone decreased from 34.2% in      2013 to 26.4% in 2019 among women aged 21-29 years (P < .0001). Among      women aged 30-64 years, use of cytology alone decreased from 18.9% in 2013      to 8.6% in 2019 (P < .0001), whereas cotesting use increased from 14.9% in      2013 to 19.3% in 2019 (P < .0001). Annual test use for HPV testing alone      was below 0.5% in all age groups throughout the study period. Annually,      8.7%-13.6% of women aged 18-20 years received cervical cancer screening.      There were persistent differences in screening test use by metropolitan      residence and census regions despite similar temporal trends. CONCLUSIONS:      Temporal changes in the use of cervical cancer screening tests among      commercially insured women track changes in clinical guidelines. Screening      test use among individuals younger than 21 years shows that many young      women are inappropriately screened for cervical cancer.},

  abstract        = {Cervical cancer screening coverage is a key monitoring indicator of the WHO cervical cancer elimination plan. We present global, regional, and national cervical screening coverage estimates against the backdrop of the 70% coverage target set by WHO. In this review and synthetic analysis, we searched scientific literature, government websites, and official documentation to identify official national recommendations and coverage data for cervical cancer screening for the 194 WHO member states and eight associated countries and territories published from database inception until Oct 30, 2020, supplemented with a formal WHO country consultation from Nov 27, 2020, to Feb 12, 2021. We extracted data on the year of introduction of recommendations, the existence of individual invitation to participate, financing of screening tests, primary screening and triage tests used, recommended ages and screening intervals, use of self-sampling, and use of screen-and-treat approaches. We also collected coverage data, either administrative or survey-based, as disaggregated as possible by age and for any available screening interval. According to data completeness and representativeness, different statistical models were developed to produce national age-specific coverages by screening interval, which were transformed into single-age datapoints. Missing data were imputed. Estimates were applied to the 2019 population and aggregated by region and income level. We identified recommendations for cervical screening in 139 (69%) of 202 countries and territories. Cytology was the primary screening test in 109 (78%) of 139 countries. 48 (35%) of 139 countries recommended primary HPV-based screening. Visual inspection with acetic acid was the most recommended test in resource-limited settings. Estimated worldwide coverage in women aged 30-49 years in 2019 was 15% in the previous year, 28% in the previous 3 years, and 32% in the previous 5 years, and 36% ever in lifetime. An estimated 1·6 billion (67%) of 2·3 billion women aged 20-70 years, including 662 million (64%) of 1·0 billion women aged 30-49 years, had never been screened for cervical cancer. 133 million (84%) of 158 million women aged 30-49 years living in high-income countries had been screened ever in lifetime, compared with 194 million (48%) of 404 million women in upper-middle-income countries, 34 million (9%) of 397 million women in lower-middle-income countries, and 8 million (11%) of 74 million in low-income countries. Two in three women aged 30-49 years have never been screened for cervical cancer. Roll-out of screening is very low in low-income and middle-income countries, where the burden of disease is highest. The priority of the WHO elimination campaign should be to increase both screening coverage and treatment of detected lesions; however, expanding the efforts of surveillance systems in both coverage and quality control are major challenges to achieving the WHO elimination target.

METHODS: ECAs in 135,766 reports were compared over three seven-year periods between 1992 and 2012. Conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) smear tests were used in the first two periods and ThinPrep (Hologic Corp., Bedford, Massachusetts, USA) tests were used in the third. RESULTS: Significant increases in satisfactory smears, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells (AGUS/AGCs) were seen in the second and third periods (P <0.001). No significant increases were observed among low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) (P >0.05). An increase was noted in carcinomas between the first and second periods although a significant decline was seen in the third (P <0.014). CONCLUSION: Satisfactory smears, ASCUS and AGUS/AGC increased during the study period although no significant increases in LSILs, HSILs or carcinomas were observed.},

  abstract   = {Background:              In the low resource settings of a developing country, a conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) test is the mainstay screening system for cervical cancer. In order to counsel women and to organize a public health system for cervical cancer screening by Pap smear examination, it is imperative to know the pattern of premalignant and malignant lesions. This study was undertaken to find out the prevalence of an abnormal Pap smear, in a tertiary hospital of a developing country, and to carry out a clinicopathological and demographical analysis for establishing the pattern of epithelial cell abnormality in a Pap smear.                                      Materials and Methods:              A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out in a total of 1699 patients who underwent Pap smear examination. The prevalence of epithelial cell abnormality in the Pap smear was calculated in proportions / percentages. Specimen adequacy and reporting was assessed according to the revised Bethesda system.                                      Results:              Among the total of 1699 patients who had their Pap smear done, 139 (8.18%) revealed epithelial cell abnormality. Altogether 26 smears revealed high-grade lesions and malignancy, most of which were found to be in women belonging to the 30 - 39 and ≥ 45 age group. A total of 75 (53.96%) women were in the 20 - 44 age group and 64 (46.04%) were in the ≥ 45 age group. A bimodal age distribution was detected in the epithelial cell abnormality, with the bulk being diagnosed in patients aged 45 or above. Overall one-third of the patients with an abnormal Pap smear result showed healthy cervix in per vaginal examination.                                      Conclusions:              A raised prevalence of epithelial cell abnormality reflects the lack of awareness about cervical cancer screening. Women aged 45 or above harbor the bulk of premalignant and malignant lesions in the Pap smear, signifying that these women are among the under users of cytological screening.},

  abstract = {Background              The 2012 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Consensus Guidelines provide information for managing abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors. According to these guidelines for Pap smear diagnosis of Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, reflex high risk (HR) human papilloma virus (HPV) genotyping is required among women 21 years of age or older. Whereas, in women of 30 to 65 years of age, HR‐HPV can be ordered by the clinicians as part of co‐testing with any diagnosis and every 5 years with a negative Cervico‐Vaginal Pap test (CVPT).                                      Methods              A retrospective review of the CoPath database of the Pathology Department at the University of Florida, College of Medicine Jacksonville, FL, was performed to identify North Florida (NF) women who underwent CVPT and HR‐HPV testing between 2006 and 2014. The women were stratified by race and age, respectively.                                      Results              The study included 19,933 CVPTs. Significant differences in the outcomes' distributions were found among age and race groups, respectively. Highest prevalence of HPV positivity was found in African American women, and in 14‐ to 20‐year‐old women, respectively. Twenty‐ to 30‐year‐old women had the highest percentage (59%) of epithelial abnormality. The most common HR‐HPV genotypic distribution was other HR‐HPV.                                      Conclusions              This study underscores the importance of using both HR‐HPV and CVPT for screening for cervical cancer, and confirms the need for special focus on managing high‐risk populations subgroups, such as African American women, and women of ages 14 to 20 years especially in high‐risk populations.},

The present retrospective analysis was performed in 1089 female outpatients with a positive HPV test result who had undergone a cervical cytology test at the gynaecological clinic, West China Second Hospital, Sichuan University, China, between January 2014 and December 2016. Of the 1089 patients with HPV infection, multiple HPV genotypes were detected in 220 patients (20.20%). Among the 1368 HPV genotypes detected, 1145 (83.70%) were high-risk subtypes. The most common genotypes were HPV-52 (18.64%), HPV-16 (16.59%), HPV-58 (13.23%), HPV-18 (6.80%), HPV-56 (5.56%) and HPV-59 (5.56%). Cervical cytology revealed abnormal cells in 430 (39.49%) patients. The most common diagnoses were atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US; 236 cases, 54.88%), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL; 151 cases, 35.12%), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL; 63 cases, 14.65%) and atypical glandular cells (AGC; 21 cases, 4.88%). HPV-66 was significantly associated (              P              = 0.037) with ASC; HPV-52 and HPV-56 were significantly associated with LSIL (              P              = 0.009 and 0.026, respectively); HPV-16 (              P              < 0.001), HPV-33 (              P              = 0.014) and HPV-58 (              P              = 0.003) were significantly associated with HSIL; and HPV-16 (              P              = 0.005) was significantly associated with AGC. HPV-16, HPV-52 and HPV-58 are associated with different diagnoses in patients with positive cervical cytological findings.},

In and before 2013, the targets of 20-year-old cervical cancer screening were females born in and before 1993, i.e., those who could not have received HPV vaccination because it was not yet publicly introduced. The targets during 2014-2019 are, or will be, those born in 1994-1999, i.e., those who came of age during a period with the highest HPV immunization rate. We analyzed the statistical data for each birth year, for the cumulative HPV vaccination rates achieved as of age 16, and for the corresponding results of cervical cancer screening at age 20. The rate of abnormal findings in cervical cytology increased slightly from 3.68% in 2010 (birth year: 1990) to 4.35% in 2013 (birth year: 1993); however, it dynamically dropped to 2.99% in 2014 (birth year: 1994) and 3.03% in 2015 (birth year: 1995). In total, the rate of abnormal findings in cervical cytology was 3.96% in 2010-2013, but significantly dropped to 3.01% in 2014-2015 (              p               = 0.014).

Design              Trend analysis of cancer registry data recorded between 1971 and 2013.                                      Setting              England.                                      Participants              132 493 women aged 20-84 with a diagnosis of cervical cancer.                                      Outcome measure              Cervical cancer incidence data were modelled using a modified age period cohort model able to capture both increased exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV) as well as changes in the age of exposure to HPV in young cohorts. Observed rates were compared with counterfactual baseline rates under a no-screening scenario to estimate the protective effect of screening.                                      Results              Rates of cervical cancer incidence have been decreasing since the introduction of screening but are projected to increase in the future under the current scenario. Between 1988 and 2013, it was estimated that screening had prevented approximately 65 000 cancers. Moreover, in 2013, the age-standardised rate (ASR) estimated under the no-screening scenario (37.9, 95% CI 37.4 to 38.3) was threefold higher among women aged 20-84 than the observed ASR (12.8, 95% CI 12.3 to 13.3). We estimate that the age of first HPV exposure has decreased by about 1 year every decade since the early 1970s (women born in 1955 onwards).                                      Conclusions              Our results corroborated the importance of screening in preventing cervical cancer and indicated future rates are dependent on age at HPV exposure. Estimated future rates can be used for healthcare planning while the counterfactual baseline to quantify the impact of HPV vaccination in microsimulations.},

The ACS recommends that individuals aged >65 years who have no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or more severe disease within the past 25 years, and who have documented adequate negative prior screening in the prior 10 years, discontinue all cervical cancer screening (              qualified recommendation              ). These new screening recommendations differ in 4 important respects compared with the 2012 recommendations: 1) The preferred screening strategy is primary HPV testing every 5 years, with cotesting and cytology alone acceptable where access to US Food and Drug Administration‐approved primary HPV testing is not yet available; 2) the recommended age to start screening is 25 years rather than 21 years; 3) primary HPV testing, as well as cotesting or cytology alone when primary testing is not available, is recommended starting at age 25 years rather than age 30 years; and 4) the guideline is transitional, ie, options for screening with cotesting or cytology alone are provided but should be phased out once full access to primary HPV testing for cervical cancer screening is available without barriers. Evidence related to other relevant issues was reviewed, and no changes were made to recommendations for screening intervals, age or criteria for screening cessation, screening based on vaccination status, or screening after hysterectomy. Follow‐up for individuals who screen positive for HPV and/or cytology should be in accordance with the 2019 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology risk‐based management consensus guidelines for abnormal cervical cancer screening tests and cancer precursors.},

  abstract        = {Infections with human papillomavirus (HPV) are common and transmitted by direct contact. Although the great majority of infections resolve within 2 years, 13 phylogenetically related, sexually transmitted HPV genotypes, notably HPV16, cause - if not controlled immunologically or by screening - virtually all cervical cancers worldwide, a large fraction of other anogenital cancers and an increasing proportion of oropharyngeal cancers. The carcinogenicity of these HPV types results primarily from the activity of the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which impair growth regulatory pathways. Persistent high-risk HPVs can transition from a productive (virion-producing) to an abortive or transforming infection, after which cancer can result after typically slow accumulation of host genetic mutations. However, which precancerous lesions progress and which do not is unclear; the majority of screening-detected precancers are treated, leading to overtreatment. The discovery of HPV as a carcinogen led to the development of effective preventive vaccines and sensitive HPV DNA and RNA tests. Together, vaccination programmes (the ultimate long-term preventive strategy) and screening using HPV tests could dramatically alter the landscape of HPV-related cancers. HPV testing will probably replace cytology-based cervical screening owing to greater reassurance when the test is negative. However, the effective implementation of HPV vaccination and screening globally remains a challenge.},
